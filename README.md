This project was created for the intents and purposes of creating an employee directory using React App.The directory generate an employee table for users to view based on a third-party API.Users will be able to see a table of employees, search by first name of the employee, and a sort feature.  Execution of this requires that we: <ul>
<li> Have an understanding of React and how to use it
<li> Being able to correctly deploy to heroku
<li> Troubleshooting errors along the way
</ul>

The project is done through the use of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)  with aide from [NPM documentations](https://www.npmjs.com/).
